## Design Principles

### 1. **Rooted in tradition, built for daily play**
Modern presentation of ancient attention practices:
- **Susokkan** (counting breath meditation)
- **Gong listening** (auditory focus)
- **Walking meditation** (movement + counting)
- **Mindful breathing** (belly awareness)
- **Body scanning** (somatic awareness)

### 2. **Meet the mind where it is**
- Users self-assess scatteredness (0-10 scale)
- System suggests or adapts game modes accordingly
- Pre and post-session tracking shows impact

### 3. **Choice and agency**
- Users can always pick their preferred mini-game
- Five modes available from day one
- **Body Sweep** unlocks when stability increases
- No forced progression or gatekeeping

### 4. **Game as mirror of mind**
- Gameplay rhythm reflects internal state
- Precision tracking shows attention quality
- Visual and audio feedback adapts to calmness
- Self-reflection integrated into every session
